    Skits. Beloved by skateboarders, 90s rappers, and middle school talent show participants alike.
    <br>Wherever there is a bunch of footage of grown folks playing on their wheelie-toys, there is frequently the inexplicable urge for those same people to try their hand at acting. When they want to be funny, they commonly aren’t. And when they try to get seriously dramatic, that’s when the real comedy begins.<br><br>
	Be it <a href="https://vimeo.com/79616863#t=3240s" target="blank">Stevie Williams getting killed</a>, <a href="https://vimeo.com/261051184#t=1759s" target="blank">Rick Howard being killed</a>, or <a href="https://vimeo.com/69434949#t=268s" target="blank">Steve Berra getting killed</a>, skateboarding has a long and storied legacy of video skits. Forcefully taking the baton of skate-skitdom is the WKND crew. They may not be Shortys-team-riding-around-on-horses-for-no-reason good, but they are pretty entertaining. Chief among these thespians is non-cancelled Jordan Taylor, known for his boyish charm and complete apparent lack of self-awareness.<br><br>
	So, as we sit and wait for the new Jordan Taylor part to drop so we can complete the data for <i>that</i> article (mid-March my ass!), let’s take a comedic detour.
	<br><br>
	Ladies and gentlemen, feast your eyes upon the acting skills of Gordo.

	<h2>Methodology</h2>
  <p>
    4Ply Magazine enlisted a team of qualified (i.e. were willing to participate) reviewers to watch a pre-selected sampling of skits that feature Jordan Taylor. The critics watched all the videos Clockwork Orange style, giving a rating to each along with any comments. These ratings were averaged to create a final Score for each skit. Skits with a Score under 70% are considered ‘Rotten’ because that is how Rotten Tomatoes does it, we think.<br>
	In an effort to solicit honest commentary, all published reviews are not accredited to any specific critics.
	<br>
  	<br>
  </p>
  	<h2>The Critics</h2>
  	<p>
    Our team of knowledgable skit-pundits was gathered from a varied pool consisting of Jordan’s colleagues and teammates, various skateboarding literati, 4Ply staff and well-wishers, and randos who responded to our call for participants on Instagram. Here is a breakdown of how they know of Jordan:<br><br>

	<b>“Costumes and makeup were a 10, but lackluster acting. Not hating too much because I know this is early stuff."<br><br>

	“While Gordo's commitment to the role is admirable, I feel the real unsung hero is the gentleman who took the ball to the chest nearly point blank.”<br><br>

	“I don’t think goths drink rose, probably red wine if at all. This inaccuracy merits points off.”<br><br>

	“Boring.”<br><br></b>

	<b>Synopsis:</b> Rapper Gordo Jizzy takes us on a tour of his property and lifestyle in an all new episode of Cribs.<br><br>

	<b>“Little cringe - but we all went to high school with this guy."<br><br>

	“A very humbling plot. I appreciate the candidness of Gordo Jizzy's character. Sometimes even the elite of the elite deal with relationship turmoil and recycled cigarettes. We could all learn something from this.”<br><br>

	“Actually had no idea Gordo was this funny. Ahaha.”<br><br>

	<b>Synopsis:</b> A shortage of chicken nuggets at the local fast foodery results in tragedy in this 15 second skit.<br><br>

	<b>“I heard this was based on a true story. The person I heard it from is a compulsive liar, but regardless, it's compelling how such a compelling narrative can be told in such a compact format. A coward would have cut away before the gruesome explosion. But not them. Outstanding.”<br><br>

	“Loved how close the fast food place was to a cliff.”<br><br>

	“I've seen better.”<br><br></b>

	<b>Synopsis:</b> Jordan has had quite enough being taunted for being an Am, and he isn’t going to take it anymore.<br><br>

	<b>“The build up was hard to watch but very necessary for the cathartic pay off.”<br><br>

	“Loves when the dudes are just still in the car during the fight, and when he hits Johan in the neck, his glasses go up and down.”<br><br>

	“Jordan was born for this role.”<br><br>

	"Mr. spaghetti man really put it over the top.”<br><br>

	“I know Gordo isn't the first performer to portray multiple characters within the same piece. But I've yet to see anybody with half the vitality and pasta in their roles as I see here.”<br><br>

	<b>“If they're serious about this issue, kudos for doing it. If it's for sake of skits, not cool.”<br><br>

	“It's a bold move when actors decide to get political, but I think this piece pays off. The nice dog really brings it home too.”<br><br>
