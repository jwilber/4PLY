        The results are in, Andrew Allen is a beast and his switch handrail game is fucked. We got the data together and did a little statistical analysis, so here's a conversation with AA about his skating and some sweet charts to go along with it.
        <br><br><br>

        <div class="qna"><p>
        BW: What’s up Andrew Allen, hows it going?<br>
		<b>AA: Pretty good man, how are you?</b><br>

		BW: Yeah not bad, have you seen any of these before?<br>
		Aa: I saw the Fred Gall article so I know what kinda direction you guys are headed in<br><br>

		Bw: We've done our research. We went through all your parts and put every trick into a big fat spreadsheet and got to investigating. <br>
		Aa: Damn<br><br>
		Bw: Yea.. We got it all here, is there anything in particular you want to know?<br>
		Aa: Well i mean umm.. I guess not. I never really thought about the statistics or data of what I've done. In terms of what's been on video it's like, I’ve always just tried to have everything I’ve done under my belt be like as big as possible, so i guess i’ll be interested to see like what tricks statistically i’ve done the most, and then try to think in my mind if that’s actually pertainable to like what i think i've done myself or you know, how I skate in my mind.<br><br>
		Bw: What trick do you think you’ve done the most?<br>
		Aa: Maybe like a switch crook? Or like an ollie? I have no clue<br><br>

    			<p><br>
        bw: lots of nbds, you just like the feeling of landing a new trick?<br>

		<p>Aa: Yeah for sure, like I said before I do have an idea of all these things I've filmed and all the tricks that I’ve done. Some tricks I've only done one time and it's been on camera but then there's other things I've done a lot and never filmed you know what I mean, because I've never found a spot or i dont think it looks good or like, i just don't want to.<br><br></p>

		<p> Bw: So like uhh, your top flatground tricks look pretty clean, but your handrail/hubba/ledge tricks.. the most you’ve done any trick is like 2 or 3 times. What's up with that?<br>

		Aa: For me personally I put a lot of goals on myself to do tricks that I've never done before, you know? Whether it's like doing a new trick on a quarterpipe like some stall, or actually trying to do like, I mean it hasn’t been this way for a while but like doing a new trick on a handrail you know what i mean? I think I just don’t like doing the same tricks all the time. I like to do something to know what it feels like then I don’t care to do it again hahaha. Never wanted to train I guess, didn’t seem fun.

        <br><br><br></b>Some people stick to what theyre good at, AA will do it just to do it. He's got darkslides, switch whatever on handrails, but he's somehow never filmed a tre flip? come on Andrew.
        <br><br>

    </p>
    <div class="qna"><p>


    	Bw: Out of 433 tricks you’ve got 5 manny tricks, what's up with that?<br>
		Aa: Damn i thought there would’ve been less dude ahaha<br><br>
		Bw: Not a manny man?<br>
		Aa: Nah i suck at em dude they're hard<br><br>
		Bw: What about the tre flips?<br>
		Aa: I can’t do it dude<br><br>
		Bw: You got switch tres though?
		Aa: Yeah i can do it switch, i mean i can do it regular like in a game of skate but i would never attempt to film one.<br>
		Aa: I can’t do impossibles. Or hardflips. Or back smiths. Or frontside airs. It sucks because they are all “style” tricks and when I try or do them they look gross so I don’t do em haha.<br><br>
		Bw: Pressure flips?<br>
		Aa: Cant pressure at all.<br><br>

<h5>Leftovers</h5>
	**mini analysis of leftovers**

	<div class="qna">
  <p>
    Bw: what's up with all the leftovers? You got more leftovers and leftover leftovers than parts, but none of them seem like throwaways. What's up with that? <br>
	Aa: I go through phases where I just like film a lot, you know, I've never really done a thing where I've filmed for one part specifically, you know. Like during the propeller thing it was like oh yeah we’re gonna make this Vans video you know, but through the filming of that, i was there for such a long time that like, in reality, in 2004 when i started going on vans trips that's when we originally started filming for the ‘vans video’ so i started filming for it then but it never came out, it kept getting pushed back and there were different filmers and the team was changing so like some of my first video parts were all really supposed to be for the vans video but because there wasn't time you know they just got pushed into other stuff like 411 and like some antihero thing and then the thrasher video. <br><br>

	Bw: you filmed for the vans video for 10 years and had half a part?<br>
	AA: Yeah kinda, in 2007 they were like 'ok we're really gonna start doing this, they got greg hunt involved', and then around that time I ended up getting hurt so I wasn't really involved with a lot of the filming trips and stuff. When it came time for the video to get cut i had some stuff that I had filmed and then Greg thought it’d be kinda cool to have me and Dustin share the part, which i was fine with, because like i didn't feel like I had anything that was like bangers or whatever you want to call it, I just had a lot of like ok footage that looked kinda cool or whatever but nothing that was like holy shit that was crazy, and dustin had THAT. He had these gnarly tricks so i think kinda putting it together, it kinda worked but then there was that extras stuff and same with the boys of summer thing. We filmed for like a year or whatever and then like i used the first stuff and then i had all this extra shit and it was like well lets put that out, make something with that you know. And that's just how it kinda happened, there was no thought behind it it just kinda came to be that way. <br>

        Another way to compare how Freddy’s output differs with each part is to compare the distribution of various
        metrics
        across them. Each block in the chart below is made up of one-hundred squares, each representing one percent.
