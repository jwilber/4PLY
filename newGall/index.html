When weathered skaters tell tales of Uncle Freddy, we often speak of his appetite for excess,
his unexpected longevity, and his undeniable likability. Skate folklore yarns are spun of daring
rescues from burning buildings and wallride attempts on moving vehicles [links]. He is part
action hero, part comic relief, and all skateboarding legend.
<br><br>
It is near impossible to quantify the impact he has had on skateboarding lo these many years.
But once we look past the hedonism and the heroism, what we can quantify are the skate clips
themselves. What emerges from the data is a portrait of a cradle-to-grave skater who advanced
switch tech-gnar progre ssion on two coasts before becoming the archetype of an entire genre of
skating loosely defined as “crust”. So set down your bondo and crack a cold one if that’s your
thing… it’s time to crunch the numbers on Fred Fuckin’ Gall.

  <h1>All The Gall</h1>

<p>
Nearly all the parts logged for this article, along with abstracts, biographical
        considerations, highly opinionated commentary, some observations from Fred himself, and lots
        of synonyms for “gnarly” can be found over in the series of All the Gall blog posts on the Warm
        Up Zone website. We also highly recommend the thorough Chrome Ball Incident interview with
        Freddy featuring dozens of accompanying photos. [Links]

  <p>
    Looking at the chart of Freddy’s top tricks over the entirety of his career, which can be toggled between specific tricks or tricks grouped together by their dominant component, we aren’t confronted with many surprises. Ollies top the list, be they over obstacle, on flat, or off some sort of launch, with over 50% of those being landed into some sort of embankment. As we scroll down the list, we see all the familiar Freddy moves one would expect: Backside wallrides, treflips, frontside 50s, switch frontside 180s, and backside 360s.
<br><br>
[gif of Freddy ollieing into that NYC spot with cornrows]
<br><br>
When we group similar tricks together, it is interesting to see some maneuvers rise in the rankings. When all wallride variations are combined (and there were 22 unique variations of wallrides) it tops the list at 52 instances, a hefty 7% of his entire output. Also of note is that while Fred only recorded 5 straight up frontside 5-0 grinds; but when we total up all variations that include a frontside 5-0 component (such as the popular switch frontside 180 to frontside 5-0), it is one of his more signature tricks.
<br><br>
What you aren’t seeing in the chart above are the tricks that Freddy just didn’t do that often, or ever. And some of those might surprise you. 
<br><br>
We chatted with Freddy and mentioned some of these missing tricks.
<li>
<ul><b>Smith Grinds</b> - nearly 700 tricks and the only thing even resembling a smith grind is a single smith stall in a pool. Says Fred: “I had one smith grind ever in my entire life. It was a back smith down the Phoenix Hubba and it was in a Habitat tour section of a video or something.” We’ve searched and still haven’t found it.
</ul>
<ul><b>Hardflips</b> - Unless we’re talking nollie, there aren’t any to be found.
</ul>
<ul><b>FS Crooked Grinds</b> - Not once. Ever. Says Fred: “I can’t do those to save my life.”
</ul>
<ul><b>Fakie flip tricks</b> - when it comes to fakie flip tricks, Freddy just dabbled here and there. Fakie kickflips, fakie heelflips, and fakie 360flips only happened once each. 
</ul>
[fakie kickflip GIF]
<ul><b>
Switch 50-50s</b> - Freddy’s switch 50-50 on a handrail at Philadelphia’s City Hall is somewhat legendary, but we couldn’t find a photo or clip of it anywhere. Says Fred: “Its in Thrasher: On The Road. You will find that there. I have kinda a little part in there.” Since that video isn’t part of our dataset, there are zero switch 50-50 grinds anywhere. None. Says Fred: “I really didn’t switch 50 unless it’s a rail.”
</ul>
<ul><b>Nollie kickflips</b> - Nope.</ul>
<ul><b>Pressure flips</b> - Make no mistake; Those are inward heelflips. Says Fred: “Dude, no way would I do a pressure flip.”</ul>

<p>
<b>A Tale of Two Freddys</b>: When we line everything up chronologically by video parts a picture quickly emerges of two distinct phases of the career of Fred Gall with the birth of Habitat as a clear delineator between epochs. On one side we have young Alien Fred: Featuring tricks in 14 videos through the first decade of his career, this starts with the Tracker Brotherhood video from 1991 and continues through Photosynthesis in 2000 (and I’m including the 4 tricks in Danny Minnick’s 2001 Collage video in there too). On latter side we have old dirty Habitat Freddy skating in 17 videos from Habitat’s Mosaic in 2003 through an online OJ Wheels part in 2015. The distinct features of the transformation between eras would be the Transition to Transition and the Rise of Crust.
<br><br>
[gif of Freddy skating transition]
<br><br>
<b>The Transition to Transition</b>: It should come as no shock that as Fred Gall aged, a fetish for the transitions developed. In fact, if one disregards the tricks on the miniramp in Granny’s driveway and Bricktown Park during the Tracker years (plus Philadelphia’s Afro Banks [link to photo]), Alien Fred almost exclusively skates surfaces with hard angles. But from Mosaic onward over 27% of Freddy’s tricks are done on some type of transition. Fred’s most recent part from 2015 featured 56% transition tricks.
</p>
</section>
<section class='section1'>
<h1>TIMELINE: CRUST OVER TIME</h1>
    <!-- <div id="crusttime"></div> -->
<p>
  <b>A Note on Crust</b>: 
We thought it relevant to record if the trick is at a spot or obstacle that should be defined as “crust”. Considerations towards “crustiness” can include roughness of ground, dilapidation of surrounding architecture, presence of overgrown foliage, necessity of Bondo or Quikcrete, and overall shittyness of the obstacle. When we reached out to Fred and asked him how he would define crust, he simply replied, “It’s like something that people wouldn’t skate”. 
<br><br>
</p>
<center>
  <div id="crusttime"></div>
</center>
<p>
[gif of Fred skating some crusty spot]
<br><br>
<b>The Rise of Crust</b>: Nowadays, Freddy’s skating is synonymous with rugged, dilapidated, shit obstacles. But it wasn’t always so. When all the Gall is taken into account, we are only looking at crust about 25% of the time. If this number seems low, that is almost entirely based on the fact Fred didn’t even start to taste crust until Timecode, and even then it was just that crazy Philadelphia Underground rock thing [link to photo]. In fact, Alien Fred’s videos only hit the crust with his tricks an average of 2.8% of the time. Contrast that to Habitat Freddy, who crusted it up 34% of the time. And this trend continues crustwards, with a solid 50% crust in his six video appearances since 2012, peaking out with harsh 82% of tricks qualifying as “on crust” in his most recent part for OJs from 2015.

The table above includes all the videos logged for this analysis along with a small sampling of the many, many trends that can be tracked from the data. Some correlations remained consistent, such as the length of the video and the number of lines included; Other observations, such as the strange spike in clips featuring one of both pant legs cinched up, are just baffling on a bunch of levels. 
While wallrides, a trick Freddy debuted with a monster kickflip to backside variation that landed him on the cover of Transworld, took prominence in the middle portion of his career, flip tricks (in which we include all variations including impossibles and shove-its) have remained surprisingly present even as his taste for transition has grown over the years.

Another way to compare how Freddy’s output differs with each part is to compare the distribution of various metrics across them. Each block in the chart below is made up of one-hundred squares, each representing one percent. Click on the videos below to see the percentage of each metric in the selected video. Some observations we saw in this data:
</p>
<br><br>
<li>
<ul><b>No SlowMo</b>: For whatever reason Freddy’s skating is rarely presented in slow motion. In fact there are just 12 slow-mo tricks in his entire catalog. If you take Eastern Exposure 3 out of the mix, you’re watching Freddy at regular speed nearly 99% of the time. For comparison, 17% of Jim Greco’s career tricks have been in slow motion [link to Jenkem article]. </ul>

<ul><b>All Sides</b>: When it comes to lips, ledges, or spinning rotation, Fred shows no favorites and only does things frontside 7.9% more often than backside. {If I am interpreting the fs and bs perc correctly}</ul>
<ul><b>Manny-Busters</b>: Fred Gall keeps all four wheels on the ground (or wall). There were only 3 wheelies total… all of nose variety.
Something about foot down correlating to transition and ditch skating here, maybe.</ul>
<ul><b>Switching It Up</b>: Overall, Freddy attacked switch (or nollie) about 27% of the time. But this is heavily skewed towards the earlier part of his career. From Eastern Exposure 2 (1994) through Photosynthesis (2000), 47.5% of his tricks were started switch or nollie. This fell off a good deal for the latter portion of his career as post-Photosynthesis Habitat Freddy averages a 15.4% switch/nollie rate. (Note: this doesn’t include tricks that start in normal stance but are executed mostly switch (such as this fabulous backside 180 to switch backside 5-0 in SF [photo]).</ul>

      <h2>Data & Methodology</h2>
      <p>
        <br>
        For this article we logged all of Freddy’s tricks from 31 different skate videos
        totaling over 63 minutes of footage. The parts varied in length from three clips in Zoo York’s
        Peep This to the five minute masterpiece of Inhabitants. Footage from several iPath tour videos,
        Shorty’s DIY park features, instagram footage compilations, and Habitat Field Logs were not
        included.
        <br>
        All efforts were made to remove identical clips that were featured in more than one video (for
        example: Habitat’s Origins only had 3 tricks that weren’t already logged in Lowcard’s Worst
        Skater of the Year part).
        <br>
        Freddy has had 3 retrospective parts. Of these, Eastern Exposure Zero and the secret part from
        the Inhabitants DVD [links] were not included. Tricks from Thrasher’s 2013 Dirts Win
        retrospective that were not featured elsewhere were added to the data.
        
        <br><br> The data for the analysis is available <a href="https://github.com/jwilber/4ply_data/blob/master/koston/data/koston.csv">here</a>. Code used for the analysis is <a href="https://github.com/jwilber/4ply_data/blob/master/article_template/create_aggregate_csv_files.py">here</a>.
