        <p class="intro">

       When I first started getting involved with 4ply I couldn't imagine that anyone would be interested in an interview without being tricked into it. I had Boo's number from a prank call marathon in 2018 where we managed to get Tony Tave and (someone) on the phone and held them up to each other. Great night. So I called Boo and told him I was from Vice australia and interviewed him. I texted him recently telling him I'd lost my job at Vice and settled for a job at 4PLY where I'd like to run the article. He said fuck yea run it up. Since then I haven't heard from him and maybe never will. Either way I think its worth posting. Boo is awesome and I mean no disrespect by posting this article, I just think it's really funny. Boo, if you're reading this, you're wearing white shoes in 20% of your footy and wearing a hat in 93%.

		<b>So for this thing we logged every trick, counting all the stairs, what kind of spot, everything.</b><br>
		Damn!
		<br><br>

		<b>What trick do you think you’ve done the most?</b><br>

        I’d say a front shuv or a hardflip. Maybe a 50-50 grind. Too many 50-50’s.<br><br>

        Damn thats a hard one. What about, ooh this is a good one. How many clips was I wearing white shoes in? Because I wear a looot of white shoes. Or how many times I'm not wearing a hat.

        <b>What's your favourite spot?</b><br>


        Probably MACBA, Barcelona. If I could get flown anywhere that’s where I would get flown to. 
        <br><br>
        <b>Favourite beer? Favourite weed?</b><br>


        Red Stripe for beer, classic OG for weed.



        <br><br>

        <b>What about skating? Favourite skate weed?</b><br>

        I'd rather be level headed than stoned while skating. Save it for the after.



        <br><br>

        <b>Had any interesting dreams lately?</b><br>

       I haven't actually, I was talking about that the other day, been pretty blank sadly.



        <br><br>

    


        <b>I guess weed does that.</b><br>

        Yeah man, shit, on sober days I definitely have like exotic dreams.</i>


        <br><br>

        <b>Exotic?</b><br>
        I dont remember but definitely Intense. Alien shit.



        <br><br>

    


        <b>Do you believe in aliens?</b><br>

        Hell yeah.

        <br><br>

        <b>How do you feel about them?</b><br>

       Shit man I just wish the government would be straight forward and just let people know what the deal is. It could be anything you know, technology is so enhanced nowadays, they could be doin’ it or they could be in touch with aliens, who knows?



        <br><br>

    


        <b>What do you think the deal is?</b><br>

        I think they got their shit out there.. yeah.</i>

        <br><br>

        <b>So are you a conspiracy kinda guy?</b><br>

       Nah not really.



        <br><br>

    


        <b>Was 9/11 an inside job?</b><br>

        Uhhh yeah I think so. That was when Bush was in. Those motherfuckers had a lot of money, I wouldn’t put it past them. I don't think another country is like that crazy to come and bomb us like that. No one does that besides crazy ass white people.

        <br><br>

        <b>Are you a vegetarian?</b><br>

       Nah I’m pescatarian, I haven't had red meat for like 2 years, haven't had chicken or anything for almost a year. I did it because I'm like dude. I've been eating this shit for 25 years, I just wanna take like a 5 year break. I stopped when I was 25 and I’ll stop ‘til I'm like 30. I was eating burgers and this and that. If I do go back to it I only want to eat the best of the best, like some proper steak, a nice little 6oz or something. 
<br><br>

        <b>That's the way to do it I guess, no point eating some shitty meat. Bad meat is bad for you, good meat is good for you right? </b><br>

        Yeah especially for someone like us, it's like, if you havent had it for years and want to go back to it you cant just go back to like a fuckin’ burger. No point. But yeah it feels good man not eating fast food or any of that bullshit. The first like 6 months is hard but afterwards it's just like <i>'What? I wasn't missing out on shit.'</i>

        <b>When I look at these charts I always think about how like Jerry Hsu’s Bag of Suck part is mostly switch and nollie because of that ankle injury. Your switch skating dropped off a bit around 2017. Did something happen?</b><br>

        I think so yeah, like actually swear to god. At the end of Chronicles one of the last tricks I wanted to try was switch bigflip front board before I could do them really. It's like this rail that Sean Malto back over crook nollie flipped. It's like a long rail and I just like drove 2 hours straight to it and I went to warm up with like a switch board and on the switch board I just like folded my shit. I just sat right on it on my left ankle. So yeah like deadass that happened. I fucked myself and I never even got it looked at really. That was before I was like down to go get shit checked out and like worked on. And I just worked it myself and it has full range again, its fine.
