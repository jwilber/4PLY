      When weathered skaters tell tales of Uncle Freddy, we often speak of his appetite for excess,
      his unexpected longevity, and his undeniable likability. Skate folklore yarns are spun of daring
      rescues from burning buildings and wallride attempts on moving vehicles [links]. He is part
      action hero, part comic relief, and all skateboarding legend.
      <br><br>
      It is near impossible to quantify the impact he has had on skateboarding lo these many years.
      But once we look past the hedonism and the heroism, what we can quantify are the skate clips
      themselves. What emerges from the data is a portrait of a cradle-to-grave skater who advanced
      switch tech-gnar progre ssion on two coasts before becoming the archetype of an entire genre of
      skating loosely defined as “crust”. So set down your bondo and crack a cold one if that’s your
      thing… it’s time to crunch the numbers on Fred Fuckin’ Gall.

  <h1 class='section-header'>All The Gall</h1>

  <p>
    Nearly all the parts logged for this article, along with abstracts, biographical
    considerations, highly opinionated commentary, some observations from Fred himself, and lots
    of synonyms for “gnarly” can be found over in the series of All the Gall blog posts on the Warm
    Up Zone website. We also highly recommend the thorough Chrome Ball Incident interview with
    Freddy featuring dozens of accompanying photos. [Links]

  <p>
    Looking at the chart of Freddy’s top tricks over the entirety of his career, which can be toggled between specific
    tricks or tricks grouped together by their dominant component, we aren’t confronted with many surprises. Ollies top
    the list, be they over obstacle, on flat, or off some sort of launch, with over 50% of those being landed into some
    sort of embankment. As we scroll down the list, we see all the familiar Freddy moves one would expect: Backside
    wallrides, treflips, frontside 50s, switch frontside 180s, and backside 360s.
    <br><br>
    <img src="images/gall_ny.gif" class='center'>
    <br><br>
    When we group similar tricks together, it is interesting to see some maneuvers rise in the rankings. When all
    wallride variations are combined (and there were 22 unique variations of wallrides) it tops the list at 52
    instances, a hefty 7% of his entire output. Also of note is that while Fred only recorded 5 straight up frontside
    5-0 grinds; but when we total up all variations that include a frontside 5-0 component (such as the popular switch
    frontside 180 to frontside 5-0), it is one of his more signature tricks.

  <h1 class='section-header'>Fred's Least Favorites</h1>
  <p class="story">
    What you aren’t seeing in the chart above are the tricks that Freddy just didn’t do that often, or ever. And some of
    those might surprise you.
    <br><br>
    We chatted with Freddy and mentioned some of these missing tricks.
    <li>
      <ul><b class='uline'>Smith Grinds</b> - nearly 700 tricks and the only thing even resembling a smith grind is a
        single smith
        stall in a pool. Says Fred: “I had one smith grind ever in my entire life. It was a back smith down the Phoenix
        Hubba and it was in a Habitat tour section of a video or something.”
        <span class='strike'>We've searched and still haven't found it.</span> We found it:
        <br>
        <img src="images/gall_smith.gif" class='center'>
      </ul>
      <ul><b class='uline'>Hardflips</b> - Unless we’re talking nollie, there aren’t any to be found.
      </ul>
      <ul><b class='uline'>FS Crooked Grinds</b> - Not once. Ever. Says Fred: “I can’t do those to save my life.”
      </ul>
      <ul><b class='uline'>Fakie flip tricks</b> - when it comes to fakie flip tricks, Freddy just dabbled here and
        there. Fakie
        kickflips, fakie heelflips, and fakie 360flips only happened once each.
      </ul>
      [fakie kickflip GIF]
      <ul><b class='uline'>
          Switch 50-50s</b> - Freddy’s switch 50-50 on a handrail at Philadelphia’s City Hall is somewhat legendary, but
        we couldn’t find a photo or clip of it anywhere. Says Fred: “It's in Thrasher: On The Road. You will find that
        there. I have kinda a little part in there.” Since that video isn’t part of our dataset, there are zero switch
        50-50 grinds anywhere. None. Says Fred: “I really didn’t switch 50 unless it’s a rail.”
      </ul>
      <ul><b class='uline'>Nollie kickflips</b> - Nope.</ul>
      <ul><b class='uline'>Pressure flips</b> - Make no mistake; Those are inward heelflips. Says Fred: “Dude, no way
        would I do a
        pressure flip.”</ul>
    </li>

    <b class='uline'>A Tale of Two Freddys</b>: When we line everything up chronologically by video parts a picture
    quickly emerges of
    two distinct phases of the career of Fred Gall with the birth of Habitat as a clear delineator between epochs. On
    one side we have young Alien Fred: Featuring tricks in 14 videos through the first decade of his career, this starts
    with the Tracker Brotherhood video from 1991 and continues through Photosynthesis in 2000 (and I’m including the 4
    tricks in Danny Minnick’s 2001 Collage video in there too). On latter side we have old dirty Habitat Freddy skating
    in 17 videos from Habitat’s Mosaic in 2003 through an online OJ Wheels part in 2015. The distinct features of the
    transformation between eras would be the Transition to Transition and the Rise of Crust.
    <br><br>
    [gif of Freddy skating transition]
    <br><br>
    <b class='uline'>The Transition to Transition</b>: It should come as no shock that as Fred Gall aged, a fetish for
    the transitions
    developed. In fact, if one disregards the tricks on the miniramp in Granny’s driveway and Bricktown Park during the
    Tracker years (plus Philadelphia’s Afro Banks [link to photo]), Alien Fred almost exclusively skates surfaces with
    hard angles. But from Mosaic onward over 27% of Freddy’s tricks are done on some type of transition. Fred’s most
    recent part from 2015 featured 56% transition tricks.

<section class='section1'>

  <h1 class='section-header'>The Evolution of Crust</h1>
  <img src="images/crust.gif" class='center'>
  <p>
    <b class='uline'>A Note on Crust</b>:
    We thought it relevant to record if the trick is at a spot or obstacle that should be defined as “crust”.
    Considerations towards “crustiness” can include roughness of ground, dilapidation of surrounding architecture,
    presence of overgrown foliage, necessity of Bondo or Quikcrete, and overall shittyness of the obstacle. When we
    reached out to Fred and asked him how he would define crust, he simply replied, “It’s like something that people
    wouldn’t skate”.
    <br><br>
  </p>
  <center>
    <!-- <div id="crusttime"></div> -->
    <div id="crust-timeseries"></div>
  </center>
  <p>
    <br><br>
    <b class='uline'>The Rise of Crust</b>: Nowadays, Freddy’s skating is synonymous with rugged, dilapidated, shit
    obstacles. But it
    wasn’t always so. When all the Gall is taken into account, we are only looking at crust about 25% of the time. If
    this number seems low, that is almost entirely based on the fact Fred didn’t even start to taste crust until
    Timecode, and even then it was just that crazy Philadelphia Underground rock thing [link to photo]. In fact, Alien
    Fred’s videos only hit the crust with his tricks an average of 2.8% of the time. Contrast that to Habitat Freddy,
    who crusted it up 34% of the time. And this trend continues crustwards, with a solid 50% crust in his six video
    appearances since 2012, peaking out with harsh 82% of tricks qualifying as “on crust” in his most recent part for
    OJs from 2015.

  <h1>Some Video Numbers
  </h1>
  <div id='table'></div>

  <p>
    The table above includes all the videos logged for this analysis along with a small sampling of the many, many
    trends that can be tracked from the data. Some correlations remained consistent, such as the length of the video and
    the number of lines included; Other observations, such as the strange spike in clips featuring one of both pant legs
    cinched up, are just baffling on a bunch of levels.
    While wallrides, a trick Freddy debuted with a monster kickflip to backside variation that landed him on the cover
    of Transworld, took prominence in the middle portion of his career, flip tricks (in which we include all variations
    including impossibles and shove-its) have remained surprisingly present even as his taste for transition has grown
    over the years.

    <h2>Percentage of ...</h2>
    <div id="charts"></div>
  </div>

  <p>
    Another way to compare how Freddy’s output differs with each part is to compare the distribution of various metrics
    across them. Each block in the chart below is made up of one-hundred squares, each representing one percent. Click
    on the videos below to see the percentage of each metric in the selected video. Some observations we saw in this
    data:
  </p>
  <br><br>
  <ul>
    <li style='display: list-item;'><b class='uline'>No SlowMo</b>: For whatever reason Freddy’s skating is rarely
      presented in slow
      motion. In fact there are
      just 12 slow-mo tricks in his entire catalog. If you take Eastern Exposure 3 out of the mix, you’re watching
      Freddy at regular speed nearly 99% of the time. For comparison, 17% of Jim Greco’s career tricks have been in slow
      motion [link to Jenkem article]. </li>

    <li style='display: list-item;'><b class='uline'>All Sides</b>: When it comes to lips, ledges, or spinning rotation,
      Fred shows no
      favorites and only does
      things frontside 7.9% more often than backside. {If I am interpreting the fs and bs perc correctly}</li>
    <li style='display: list-item;'><b class='uline'>Manny-Busters</b>: Fred Gall keeps all four wheels on the ground
      (or wall). There
      were only 3 wheelies total…
      all of nose variety.
      Something about foot down correlating to transition and ditch skating here, maybe.</li>
    <li style='display: list-item;'><b class='uline'>Switching It Up</b>: Overall, Freddy attacked switch (or nollie)
      about 27% of the
      time. But this is heavily
      skewed towards the earlier part of his career. From Eastern Exposure 2 (1994) through Photosynthesis (2000), 47.5%
      of his tricks were started switch or nollie. This fell off a good deal for the latter portion of his career as
      post-Photosynthesis Habitat Freddy averages a 15.4% switch/nollie rate. (Note: this doesn’t include tricks that
      start in normal stance but are executed mostly switch (such as this fabulous backside 180 to switch backside 5-0
      in SF [photo]).</li>

  <h2>Data & Methodology</h2>
  <p>
    <br>
    For this article we logged all of Freddy’s tricks from 31 different skate videos
    totaling over 63 minutes of footage. The parts varied in length from three clips in Zoo York’s
    Peep This to the five minute masterpiece of Inhabitants. Footage from several iPath tour videos,
    Shorty’s DIY park features, instagram footage compilations, and Habitat Field Logs were not
    included.
    <br>
    All efforts were made to remove identical clips that were featured in more than one video (for
    example: Habitat’s Origins only had 3 tricks that weren’t already logged in Lowcard’s Worst
    Skater of the Year part).
    <br>
    Freddy has had 3 retrospective parts. Of these, Eastern Exposure Zero and the secret part from
    the Inhabitants DVD [links] were not included. Tricks from Thrasher’s 2013 Dirts Win
    retrospective that were not featured elsewhere were added to the data.

    <br><br> The data for the analysis is available <a
      href="https://github.com/jwilber/4ply_data/blob/master/koston/data/koston.csv">here</a>. Code used for the
