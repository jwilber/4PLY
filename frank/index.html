          So do you guys have a program for this stuff or what?

            >We just log as much footage as we can find. Normally, I'll just go
            through someone's parts, but for this I went through a bunch of trip
            videos and stuff trying to get whatever I could.</b
          ><br />
          Yeah, I don’t think I have many. I only have, like, one part, some 411
          stuff, and then the rest is, like, spitfire stuff and trip stuff.
          <br /><br />
          <b>I found a couple hidden parts online.</b><br />
          My friend did make a part on vimeo called
          <a href="https://vimeo.com/201764634"
            ><i>‘Straight to Floppy Disk’.</i></a
          >
          <br /><br />
          <b
            >Yeah, there’s that, and I found this video on youtube called

            that has a bunch of footage I’d never seen.</b
          >
          <br />
          Oh yeah! Some footage at night? Yeah, somebody put together some
          footage, there’s like a library line in there, right? That’s the funny
          thing I guess, when I'm out it's not like I make a conscious effort to
          go film stuff, so a lot of it just ends up with different filmers.
          <br /><br />
          <b
            >What was the deal with
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5iIsHUmGho&"
              ><i>Maiden Days?</i></a
            ></b
          ><br />
          Wooow, you found Maiden Days! Ok, so Maiden Days was with that kid
          Kevin Candela. It was raining and he had one of those editing boards.
          It was like an old school Fisher Price my-first-editing-board kind of
          thing and we both took our footage tapes and put them together and
          that was it, on a rainy day at his house. He was like, ‘Dude I got the
          editing board! Bring over your tape!’ So I was like, ‘alright, I'll
          bring it over’ and we went through like trick trick trick trick trick
          trick as much as we could. It was sick, we only made like 3 or 4
          copies of it. That kid Kevin’s part is really sick in that, he did
          this kickflip indie on that little quarter pipe - it’s really good.
          That’s funny that you found that. GIF
          <br /><br />

            >Yeah I’ve been doing some digging. I found a

            >. You’re in it but there’s also a Lonnie Gerwer?</b
          ><br />
          Yeah, he does an ollie into the banks from, uhh, this was years and
          years ago, he goes like top ropes into the banks right?<br /><br />
          <b>Yeah, is that your brother?</b><br />
          No, no - it was just coincidence. But I did talk to him about how
          we’re both gerwers. Apparently we could be cousins. I don't know.
          Yeah, it's funny. Lonnie Gerwer.<br /><br />

            >Who won the

              ><i>Newell chair race?</i></a
            ></b
          ><br />
          I would have to go with, uhh, he had the low chair... Jon Newport! I
          think he was the fastest. He was the gnarliest.<br /><br />
          <b>Did anyone get fucked up doing that?</b><br />
          We almost fucked Dave Duren up but he kind of pulled it. He hit a
          house. That’s when there was a cop watching and he was like, "you kids
          gotta get outta here before one of you gets hurt!" and he let us race
          for like another hour. It was nuts. But I think Newport definitely
          won, he went from the highest of all the hills. And that setup he had
          was nuts. He took I think it was a kitchen chair from his house and
          his friend AJ's cruiser board trucks. He cut the legs off and screwed
          them on and he put these weird stirrups on it. It was fucked. Yeah. He
          won. He truly won. He won, but he couldn't really barely speak at any
          point. He was having a tough time. That was good.<br /><br />

            >With all this data it’s always cool to see who influences who, who
            influences the next dudes and then you know, the dudes after that.
            Who would you say influenced you the most?</b
          ><br />
          I was kind of sheltered so it was a lot of my friends that kind of
          influenced the direction of my skating, and then obviously the bones
          brigade. Like, no joke, I thought those guys were the shit. I figured
          out how to stop mongo pushing from that video. I was like 'hey, wait,
          Lance skates the same way as me but he doesn’t push the same...' and
          then I immediately thought, ‘he’s doing it wrong’. Then I was like
          ‘wait, wait, wait, hold on, I just started this’ and I went back and
          rewound it and I was like ‘Oh, they all push like that! Maybe I was
          wrong.’ That was a big thing, too. Especially when you start skating,
          to push the right way or you know, not to look like you didn’t fit in
          as much as you didn’t. So I’d say the bones brigade members. Lance
          Mountain was a huge influence because he definitely had more fun and
          the other dudes took it more seriously. They're skating vert you know.
          Lance and Tommy I’d say are the two biggest influences. I couldn't
          relate to Mike McGill or Tony Hawk at that age. They were lightyears
          ahead.I didn’t even know about vert ramps.<br /><br />

          You know you argue with your friends about why some dudes are better
          than other dudes. It’s always a personal preference. That’s what makes
          skating great - everyone has personal favorites. Everyone has their
          dudes. My dudes are Rick Howard, Mike Carroll... Plan B. Those dudes
          were like, woah: mind blowing. Henry Sanchez. It’s the ultimate
          argument through skate history - who’s your favourite and why? Always
          trying to persuade your friend and make him think that your dudes the
          best.
          <br />
          <br /><b>Your dudes are always the best dudes.</b><br />
          Yeah like Guy Mariano is the best. Hands down.<br />
          <br /><b>Was Gino a big influence growing up?</b><br />
          Yeah, for sure. A dude from Long Island that was on 101 with Natas?
          Yeah. But that only came after, like,
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l1g255U9tE"
            ><i>the Snuff video</i></a
          >
          . When you got to see his full capabilities. Could you do a Gino one
          of these?<br />
          <br /><b>That would be awesome. </b><br />
          I think Gino would probably be one of the best. You’d have a lot of
          switch back tails, a couple of switch back tail shuvs. It’d be good.
          The other day I was like, ‘I think it's like 6 or 8 times that he
          pushes in his Trilogy part.’ That was some stupid thing I remembered
          from being a kid and being like, ‘Why would I fucking count how many
          times this dude pushes?’ But then when I saw the
          <a href="/andrewallen"><i>Andrew Allen stats</i></a> and there was
          flannel stats and shit I was like, ‘Yes! Fuck dude, thats awesome, I’m
          not the only one counting fuckin’ weird shit!’ It's funny, you’re
          doing stats on Koston, who had what, 30 parts or something? And so you
          have to go back and watch like H Street Next Generation and then you
          have to watch Lick and then, you know, like, it brings you through a
          wormhole of videos that you have to watch. He’s in a 101 video and he
          just kind of runs past the camera a couple times, too.In some crazy
          shorts. He keeps falling down and you’re like ‘Dude, that's Koston
          just running around in some purple shorts? This is insane!’ Those
          videos are great. Those are the ones I know real good. Questionable.
          Virtual Reality. Ronnie Creager would be an insane one to do. This is
          where you go wormholing. Because then you’d have to go through old
          Thrasher videos, right? And almost start stats on ,like, everyone.
          Which would be insane. Someone can ask how many manual tricks has he
          done? Or about Koston's 540 tail grab on a vert ramp. How many times
          was Beagle’s hair in a completely insane afro?
          <br />
          <br /><b
            >You’ve done 4 manual tricks, 3 of them were nose manny nollie 360
            shuv out. (Two of those were in trip videos after Louie Lopez did a
            FS 180 to fakie manny to fakie shuv. Insane.) </b
          ><br />
          It's hard to 3 flip out of manuals. That's the only manual trick I can
          do. There's a better chance of making one of those because you just
          kind of take a foot off and let something happen and get it back on.
          It's a fun one. If you put your foot in the right position, it goes
          around. The nollie one is a full Rodney Mullen. I saw him do it on a
          pipe and then I just tried them on flat. And once you can do it on
          flat it's the same thing. They kind of just work.

          <b>How do you feel about the use of data in skateboarding?</b><br />
          I think it's really cool. During a boxing fight they have someone who
          counts punches, then they have someone who counts landed punches, then
          they have someone who counts missed punches. You know? I think from
          the dawn of time in baseball you could find out if the first pitch was
          a strike. And you could just find out the craziest stats.
          Skateboarding is rad. Although they might be useless to the civilian
          who’s not a skater. But think of the nutjob baseball fans out there.
          They want to know who hit 425 in 1967? Or who holds the home run
          records and all that. It’s super rad that it could be cut down to
          something similar, like how many tricks in a part, or what your height
          and weight is. You know? Something like, ‘weighing in at a buck 35.’
          It's rad. I only weigh 135 pounds and I’m 5’6ish. Trying to sneak in
          the 7.<br /><br />

          <b>We'll call it 5'7"</b><br />
          Yeah, we’ll say 7. I don’t wanna lie completely, but it's close.<br /><br />

          <b>How do you feel about skating these days?</b>
          <br />

          It seems like it's getting back to that mindset of the contest side of
          it. That’s fine - skateboarding is for everyone. If you like contests,
          you can do contests. If you like slalom, do slalom. Or if you just
          want to feel the freedom of rolling and not doing any tricks like the
          dude on the fuckin longboard, do it! He’s jamming! In his head, he’s
          jamming as hard as we think we are. That’s what matters: how you feel
          with your board and your friends at the end of the session. That's
          pretty much what skateboarding is, hanging out with your friends doing
          activities that beat yourself up. It’s not a sport. Everything's art,
          I don't know. It’s satisfying, too. Super rad to do, like, just a
          noseslide. You’re like, yeah, I just floated on that curb for a few
          seconds and then kept riding afterwards.
          <br /><br />

          <b>Some philosophical insights into skateboarding.</b><br />
          Haha, my good friend growing up was a philosophy major in college, so
          I would get little tidbits from him here and there. Which is nice.
          It’s all relative and all that shit.<br /><br />

            <b>So are you filming for anything at the moment?</b><br />
            There’s a little Converse/Krooked thing that’ll be coming out in a
            couple of months. That was the last thing. We’re trying to do a
            little Grimple video along with the Antihero video. Like, a more
            fun, goofier, whatever. Whatever Grimple is we’re gonna do that, in
            video form.<br />
            <br /><b>What <i>is</i> Grimple?</b><br />
            What is Grimple? That’s one of those questions best left unanswered.
            I’m not sure.

            <br /><br /><b>You kind of have the best team!</b><br />
            Haha, i’s nice because being a fake team we get to use dudes like
            Evan Smith. Well, not a fake team. A real team, but we can do
            anything we want because we exist in a wormhole. That’s the best
            part - we don’t follow any strict rules of what skateboarding is or
            should be.<br /><br />

            <b>Who’s the best distributor? And why is it Deluxe?</b><br />
            It’s the best because of how bad we are at it. Haha, no. it's
            because of Jim, actually. It's because of how much Jim loves
            skateboarding and how much he wants everyone to do well. We all have
            an equal hand in skateboarding, as we’ve been doing it for so long.
            He just wants everyone to be stoked. I think that's why we do as
            well as we do! We’re not trying to be cool. We're just trying to
            bring some fun to people you know and put some good skateboarding
            out, which the Real team does and the Antihero team does and so does
            Krooked. Look at all the teams, do all of them have SOTYs? Real and
            Antihero do, but Krooked has the GOAT: Mark Gonzales. You don’t need
            a SOTY if you got Mark Gonzales, you know?<br /><br />
            <b>When are you getting SOTY?</b><br />
            I’m good. You know it's one of those things you accept that you’re
            not gonna win.<br /><br />
            <b>Not with that attitude!</b><br />
            You're right. I should start jumping off roofs, I think.
            <br /><br />
            <b
              >Speaking of roofs, if you were hanging off the top of the Empire
              State Building and Will Smith and The Rock put out their hand out
              to save you, whose hand are you grabbing?</b
            ><br />
            It’s almost obvious that you’d go with The Rock. I mean, Will Smith
            is a pretty big dude, but you’d think, like, The Rock, you know he’s
            gonna be cooking it up when he yanks you off the side of the
            building. I’m going with The Rock. But he’d probably rip your arm
            off before he pulled you back up. Something would make it up.<br /><br />
            <b
              >Well said. Thanks for the interview! Looking forward to your
              upcoming projects!</b
            ><br />
            Thank you! And thanks a lot, looking forward to seeing the
            numbers!<br /><br />
