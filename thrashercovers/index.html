        Since Burnett already got mad at me for it, I'll admit that I don't read the mag very often but I've always enjoyed the big pictures on the front. The cover of Thrasher has always seemed like a pretty good measure of what the big dogs are up to, and assuming skate 'milestones' (like Jaws' 25 stair ollie) are covered by covers, it seems like you could get a pretty clean picture of the progression of skating by looking at whatever tricks made it for any given year. <br><br>

            Pretty interesting watching the decline of transition in the early days and the rise of everything else. Shoutout to 2021 for being the first year since the mid 90's to not have a handrail cover.

            Kickflip and tre flip are the only flip tricks in the top 20, and out of 519 covers there are only 14 flips into grinds/slides and 0 flips out.
            I guess flipping in/out of tricks for a photo is probably more trouble than its worth. Save it for the video part brother nobody cares.

        <h3>staircount by year</h3>
        <p>This is the highest stair count of each year split into handrails, hubbas and tricks down stairs. Hover over any of the points to see what the cover was and click to get a closer look. </p><br><br>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            <b>Rails</b><br>
            The stair count for rails plateaus around the start of the 2000's. People traded out bigger rails for better rails and it got progressively harder to get a rail cover without a kink, curve, gap or drop.
            
            Felipe Nunes' cover is the only rail outlier under the trend line but he's lightyears above the trendline for people with no legs.
            Steve Nesser deserves an honourable mention for grinding a 51 rail and crunching the whole chart. (But two 50's down two 9's is gangster).
            <br><br>

            <b>Stairs</b><br>
            Couldn't imagine a more understandable plateau. 
            If people kept trying to skate bigger stairs there's going to be a point where the impact would give everyone flamingo knees like Jaws. I guess there aren't a lot of tricks that look good down stairs in photos so until some freak ollies a 30 I doubt we'll see much stair coverage.
            <br><br>

           <!--  <b>Hubbas</b>
            <br>
            For some reason I can't see hubbas going anywhere for a long time.They just look so chunky and smooth it makes for a perfect photo. Honestly, do whatever you want. It's going to look good and you might get a cover.

           <!--  I've been trying to work out what the video equivalent of Thrasher covers would be. 411s were basically the thrasher cover of video documentation. QS top 10 fills that hole right now, but differently. Of course you'll see an 18 stair here and there but only if its cool. No one gives a fuck about jeffwons double fs flip down the double set. If QS had covers I imagine it would be mostly cool NY spots. That's why Thrasher is dominating the hard mag game. Clickbait. -->
