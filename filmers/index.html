      <p class='main-text'>Although they live behind the scenes, filmers play a very important role in skateboarding.
        By mapping their vision behind the lense into the video before I eyes, they shape their own personal brand, as
        well as define the aesthetic of the skaters and brands they represent.<br>
        This article won't go into any big theories about the role of filmmakers in skateboarding (not that size
        matters!).
        Instead, it serves as a piece to explore some of the filmers.
      </p>
      <p class='main-text'>
        There is no filmmaking in skateboarding without skateboarders. I guess this is obvious. Probably did not
        warrant the first sentence of this paragraph. But here we are.

        Moving on: Below we represent each filmmaker as a <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)">network graph</a>,
        with each circle(node). The size of the circles are based on how many times they showed up in a video from the
        corresponding filmmaker. We see two main types of structure below: highly connected graphs (representing
        filmers that film a large amount of mostly the same skaters), and low-connection graphs with distinct
        neighborhoods
        (e.g. Transworld filmers Chris Ray and Jon Holland, who prefer the one-and-done relationship with skaters.)
        The edges connect skaters that appeared in films together.
        Hover over each skater to see who they share connections with, and click-and-drag them around for a better view.

      <h3>Filmer Favorites</h3>
      <p class='main-text'>
        From the graphs above, it's clear that many filmermakers have a favorite 'cast' of favorites they film.
        Sometimes this
        is a result of the filmers preferring to film their friends. Other times, this is because the filmers are
        emlpoyed
        by a company with a fairly standard cast of skaters.
        <br><br>
        In any case, I've always wondered, which filmers are the
        most have the most consistent cast of skaters in their videos?

        To answer the question, below I've ranked the filmers by what I call the <i>uniformity index</i>:
        calculated by dividing the total number of parts a filmer has filmed by the unique number of skaters they've
        filmed.
        A value of one implies that no skaters were filmed more than once, while higher values indicate a consistent
        cast of
        skaters filmed across multiple video-parts.
        a broader range of skaters

        There are many ways to idenfity similar filmers. The style of their filming. The cameras they use.
        Keeping in line with the theme of this article, we'll investigate similarity as a metric of who the filmmakers
        include
        in their videos.


        most filmers have a crew they like to film. whether its' necaause they're a group of friends, or because they
        film on behalf of a company, it's quite common. But who has the most tight-knit crew?
        From the graphs above, it's clear that many filmers have a favorite 'cast' of favorites they film. But which
        filmers
        have the most consistent cast of skaters in their videos?

        To answer the question, below I've ranked the filmers by what I call the 'uniformity index':
        calculated by
        dividing the total number of parts a filmer has filmed, divided by the unique number of skaters they've filmed.
        Higher values of the uniformity index indicate more consistent set of skaters filmed, while those with a lower
        score film a broader range of skaters.
        The further above 1, the more loyal. A score of 1 indicates at total unique set of skaters filmed (e.g. only one
        part
        filmed per skater).

        The confirm our metric makes sense, let's look at both ends of the distribution (you can confirm the results
        visually as well,
        by looking at the network graph above). The top 3 filmmakers, Kevin
        Barnett, Beagle, and Aaron Meza, respectively,
        head
        the video content for three of the most familial teams (Toy Machine, Baker, and Girl, respectively). At the
        bottom
        end of the distribution, we see filmers for independent skateboard publications (Transworld and Digital):
        Chris Ray, Bill Weiss, and Jon Holland. As these publications employ a unique cast of skaters in each video,
        these
        results are expected.
        <br><br>
        To be honest, I'd expect Grant Yansura (WKND) and Yoan Toallandier (Magenta) to be higher up the list. I was
        also
        surprised to see Greg Hunt lower than Dan Wolfe, as the latter has filmed a

      <h2>Filmer Similarity</h2>
      <p class='main-text'>
        There are many ways to idenfity similar filmers. The style of their filming. The cameras they use.
        Keeping in line with the theme of this article, we'll investigate similarity as a metric of who the filmmakers
        include
        in their videos.
        Which filmers are the most similar, <i>with respect to whom they film?</i> To find out, we'll tweak
        some common information retreival techniques to our unique use case. In particular, we'll use TF-IDF (or,
        for our case, SF-IFF: skater-frequency inverse filmer frequency): from the global set of skaters across all
        videos,
        we'll represent each filmer as the vector of skaters they film, weighted by the number of times they filmed
        them, as well
        as the number of times they were filmed by other filmers. Next, we'll use dimensionality reduction techniques
        to map this to a two-dimensional space, so that we may more easily visualize the data (e.g. in the scatter
        plot below). As each filmer is now embedded as a representation of the skaters they film, the distance between
        the filmers represents a meaningful measure of similarity.
        And the results make sense:
        Basically, we'll represent each filmer as the vector of skaters they filmed.

      <h2>Data & Methodology</h2>
      <p class='main-text'>The data was collected from (the now basically
        defunct) skatevideosite.com.
        The data comprises videos up until July 2019. As the data in skatevideosite.com is
        user-entered, we can't guarantee total accuracy. For this reason, some of our mapping from filmmakers to skaters
        may not be perfect (corrections were made where identified). Additionally, not all filmmakers featued in the
        dataset were included - lesser-known filmers were excluded, as were filmers with less than four unique videos
        in dataset.
